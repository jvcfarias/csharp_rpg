<h1> My first C# application </h1>

Hey recruiter :wave:! 

My name is Jo√£o, I have been paving my way into becoming a fullstack developer, this is my first <strong>C# project.</strong> :happy: 

It is part of a bootcamp I've been working on. It is not a final build, so, it may be improved at any given time.
